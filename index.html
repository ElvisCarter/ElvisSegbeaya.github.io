<h1>Welcome to Elvis' World(Resume)!!!</h1>
<p>Hi Welcome! My names Elvis Segbeaya. Thank you for takin the time to visit my website. I've created this in order to alleviate the need for a formal interview 
    as those can at time be painstakingly dreadful. Lol. This gives a brief introduction into getting to know me better. I've created this site to showcase some of my talents. 
    Follow the links below to navigate to the different projects I've created in the past. I will also try to keep this site's resume updated hopefully every 3 months. 
</p>
<p>
    Thanks again for visiting my site! Hope you enjoy everything I have to offer. Also feel free to connect with me via social media("LinkedIn") or follow my GitHub page.
    Hope to hear from you soon!
